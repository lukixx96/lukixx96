- 👋 Hi, I’m @lukixx96
- 👀 I’m interested in manga, anime, videogames, gym, food, cinema, music and many other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some programming languages I haven't studied in university although they're very useful and required
- in job offers, for example python, C#, PLC, and I'd love to learn Spanish and German
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project that regards robotic and controlling. I'm an Automation Engineer and
- I love rack my brains in solving problems.
- 📫 How to reach me:
luka.ammendola@outlook.com
- 😄 Pronouns: preferred He/Him but whatever
- ⚡ Fun fact: My friends call me "Micione", in Italian it means "big cat" as I'm quite a big sized person compared to my friends 
- and I also purr as a cat when I'm around the people I love. :D
